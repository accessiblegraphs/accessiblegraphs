Respiratory testing for Covid-19 in the U.S. is shown below. The data is updated daily from the [CDC Coronavirus Cases, Data & Surveillance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html).

Widespread Covid-19 testing is crucial for many reasons. Testing helps healthcare workers identify patients with Covid-19 for adequate treatment, patients keep their loved ones and communities from getting sick, and policy-makers understand the scope of the pandemic to inform policy decisions. The bar-graph below shows respiratory tests in the U.S. over time, both by CDC labs and by U.S. public health laboratories. The most recent seven days of data are incomplete because of the lag in time between when specimens are accessed, testing is performed, and results are posted.

According to the CDC website, public health laboratories using CDC tests are no longer required to submit samples to CDC for confirmation beginning March 14th, 2020. The CDC is focusing on other ways to support public health.
