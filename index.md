The Accessible Graphics project is a collaboration between reseachers at Stanford University and the Uniersity of Michigan to investigate the state of data accessibility on the web for screen reader users during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The project consists of three parts:
* A survey of 127 screen reader users regarding their experiences and preferences accessing data on the web.
* In-depth interviews and observations of 12 screen readers interacting with online data visualizations.
* An accessibility audit of 87 data visualizations from top-ranked Google searches, conducted by web accessibility specialists.

# Study Results

Below is a summary of the results included from our paper titled: <a href="/Papers/siu2021dataCovid.pdf" target="_target"> COVID-19 Highlights the Issues Facing Blind and Visually Impaired People in Accessing Data on the Web. </a>

## Survey

### Accessing data-driven information

* 94% of respondents indicate they have concerns accessing accurate COVID-19 data.
* 17% of respondents agree that data-driven media they encounter is typically accessible with their use of technology.
* Respondents ranked trends as most commonly inaccessible, followed by information about pandemic severity, day-to-day advice, and health and safety guidelines.
* Popular types of tasks respondents would like access to data-driven information for are: orientation and mobility, data-related media, education related, work related, personal tasks, and art and expression.


### Ways of accessing information

* Respondents highlight the importance of good summary descriptions, tables for drawing their own conclusions, alternative audio and tactile methods of consumption, and improved screen reader compatability.
* Respondents looked for accessibility branded COVID-19 websites (28%), learned to interpret data using sonification techniques (25%), listened to more podcasts where trends are "better described" (21%), relied on visual interpration services or relatives (15%), or looked for download access to raw tabular data (10%). 
* 92% of respondents believe that tactile methods are helpful for exploring data graphics, while 55% indicated that they were at least compentant in using tactile graphics for data tasks. 
* 87% of respondents believe that audio-methods are helpful for exploring data graphics, while 23% indicated that they were at least compentant in using audio-methods for data tasks.

## Interview and Observations

* For accessibility-driven data websites, prior experience and domain expertise greatly affected participants' takeaways.
* Participants combined insights from multiple representations (e.g. table and alternative text) to complement information gaps and inform exploration.
* When making data comparisons, having to retain multiple quantities of information while sequentially navigating through screen readers can impose high cognitive load.
* Participants made use of interactive features such as find, linked lists, and multiple tabs to reduce the navigation effort.
* Relying on other people's interpretations of data in alternative text descriptions, discrepancies in how data is presented, and unfamiliar tools can reduce users' confidence in interpreting data.

## Data Accessibility Audit

The results of this study are currently under peer review, and will be uploaded once accepted.

The Accessible Graphics project was launched to provide important up-to-date multimodal graphics. We are continuously updating the site and expanding on the library of graphics available currently related to the COVID-19 health crisis. The project currently uses [SAS Graphics Accelerator](https://support.sas.com/software/products/graphics-accelerator/index.html) which is only supported in [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). We have provided instruction on [how to use SAS Graphics Accelerator]({% link usingSAS.md %}).

## List of data graphics available:
* [Flatten the Curve]({% link flattenTheCurve.md %})
* [Global Evolution of Covid-19 Cases]({% link plotCases.md %})
* [Rt: Effective Reproduction Rate]({% link rtlive.md %})
* [Deaths by Race]({% link deathsByRace.md %})
* [Civilian Unemployment Rate]({% link unemployment.md %})

## Project Data Collection
We are also interested in understanding the strengths and limitations of existing technologies in providing effective alternative representations. We are gathering feedback to improve how we present the graphics and to support the design of multimodal visualization libraries. Each visualization has an option to submit questions you may have about the graphic or data. Human volunteers will be answering questions. You may opt to receive an email alert when someone has posted an answer. Last, we are also collecting more general information on multimodal data literacy and the state of media accessibility.
