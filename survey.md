title: 'Survey on Accessibility in the Media'
---

You are invited to participate in an online survey investigating the experiences of adults who are blind or have low vision authoring and consuming multimodal data representations. The purpose of this research is to understand accessible methods of presenting data visualizations using audio and/or tactile feedback. To this end, the survey includes questions about your experiences with data graphics and the Covid-19 pandemic. All questions in the survey are optional.

Data graphics are increasingly presented in many aspects of data-driven news, yet many barriers still exist for making such representations accessible. By collecting this information, we hope to illuminate issues, understand barriers affecting individuals, and implement solutions needed for making authoring and consumption of data graphics accessible.

In the survey, you may provide an email to participate in a raffle for an Amazon gift card for 15USD. You do not need to complete the survey in order to enter the raffle. The raffle will be conducted after the survey ends at the end of July. Participants who opt to participate will be notified through the provided email.

## This survey has closed. Raffle winners have been notified.
