title: 'Survey on Accessibility in the Media'
---

You are invited to participate in an online survey investigating the experiences of adults who are blind or have low vision on authoring and consumption of multimodal data representations. The purpose of this research is to understand accessible methods to present data visualizations using audio and/or tactile feedback. To this end, you will be asked to participate in an online survey of your experiences exploring different data representations. There may be questions that relate to your experiences with data graphics and the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Data graphics are important for many aspects and increasingly presented in data-driven news, yet many barriers still exist for making such representations accessible. By collecting this information, we hope to illuminate issues, understand barriers affecting individuals, and implement solutions needed for making authoring and consumption of data graphics accessible.

After the survey, you may provide an email to participate in a raffle for an Amazon gift card for [amount]. The raffle will be conducted after the survey end date of [date] and participants that opt to participate will be notified through the provided email.
