title: 'Follow-Up Interviews on Accessibility in the Media'
---

You are invited to participate in an online interview investigating the experiences of adults who are blind or have low vision in authoring and consuming multimodal data representations. The purpose of this research is to understand accessible methods of presenting data visualizations using audio and/or tactile feedback. To this end, the interview includes questions about your experiences with data graphics and the Covid-19 pandemic. The interviews will be conducted remotely over Zoom and participants will be offered a 30 USD Amazon Gift Card in compensation for their time.

During the interview, you will navigate to three different websites and answer a set of questions about your experience. To participate we ask that you are comfortable with the following:
1. You are able to join a Zoom call using a desktop or laptop computer
2. You are able to share your desktop screen with the experimenter
3. You are able to navigate the websites for the study using Google Chrome
