“Flatten the curve” has become the mantra of the global effort towards mitigating and containing the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s a powerful and immensely valuable metaphor, that helps people understand why mitigation is necessary to save lives.

This graph has two curve lines and one constant flat line. Since it's a metaphor plot, the numbers don't represent real values. Instead the shape of the curves are used to communicate the message. The more people reporting with the virus on a given day, the higher the curve; which means the virus is spreading fast. This is shown as the curve 'without measures'. On the other hand, a low curve ('with measures') shows that the virus is spreading slower and fewer people are diagnosed with the disease on any given day. Keeping the curve down — diminishing the rate at which new cases occur — prevents overtaxing the healthcare systems and resources (represented as the constant 'capacity level' line).
