“Flatten the curve” has become the mantra of the global effort towards mitigating and containing the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s a powerful and immensely valuable metaphor, that helps people understand why mitigation is necessary to save lives.

This graph has two curve lines and one constant flat line. Since it's a metaphor plot, the numbers don't represent real values. Instead the shape of the curves are used to communicate the message. The more people reporting with the virus on a given day, the higher the curve; which means the virus is spreading fast. This is shown as the curve 'without prevention measures'. On the other hand, a low curve ('with prevention measures') shows that the virus is spreading slower and fewer people are diagnosed with the disease on any given day. Keeping the curve down — diminishing the rate at which new cases occur — prevents overtaxing the healthcare systems and resources (represented as the constant 'healthcare capacity level' line).

## How to Explore Using SAS
Set the Speech setting (Keyboard Shortcut C) to Off, and Navigation (Keyboard Shortcut V) to Scan Mode. Use the right/left arrow keys to sweep left and right along the x-axis of the graph. Focus on the rise and fall points of the two curves. Use keyboard shortcut S to cycle between chord and melody.
