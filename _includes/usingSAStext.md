SAS Graphics Accelerator enables users with blindness to perceive many types of charts and graphs using ear buds and a standard computer keyboard. Each data element in a chart or graph is represented by a sound. The pitch of the sound indicates position on the Y axis. Position on the X axis is communicated using the stereo effect between the left and right speakers or ear buds.

To explore a chart or graph:
1. Open Google Chrome.
2. Install [SAS Graphics Accelerator for Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sas-graphics-accelerator/ockmipfaiiahknplinepcaogdillgoko) from the Chrome Web Store.
3. Open a chart or graph page and activate the Accelerate button.
4. Press G to cycle between data groups displayed on the graph.
5. Press V until you hear "Explore Mode", then press the left/right arrow keys to explore point by point.
6. Press V until you hear "Scan Mode", then press the left/right arrow keys to play the entire chart or graph.
7. Press D to change speed.
8. If the chart or graph contains grouped data, press G to change groups.
9. Press C to cycle through settings for spoken number and text values (verbose vs. terse).
10. Press S to play multiple groups as a chord or melody.
11. Press H for additional commands.
