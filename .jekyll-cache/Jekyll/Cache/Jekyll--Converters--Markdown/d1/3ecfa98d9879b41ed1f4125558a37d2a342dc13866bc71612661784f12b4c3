<p>SAS Graphics Accelerator enables users with blindness to perceive many types of charts and graphs using ear buds and a standard computer keyboard. Each data element in a chart or graph is represented by a sound. The pitch of the sound indicates position on the Y axis. Position on the X axis is communicated using the stereo effect between the left and right speakers or ear buds.</p>

<p>To explore a chart or graph:</p>
