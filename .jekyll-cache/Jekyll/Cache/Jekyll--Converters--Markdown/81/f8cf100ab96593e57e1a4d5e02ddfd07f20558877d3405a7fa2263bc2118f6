I"{<p>The Accessible Graphics project was launched as a platform to provide important up-to-date multimodal graphics pertaining to the COVID-19 health crisis. It is continuously being updated and we are expanding on the library of graphics available <a href="/contact.html">suggestions are welcome</a>. The project currently uses <a href="https://support.sas.com/software/products/graphics-accelerator/index.html">SAS Graphics Accelerator</a>. We have provided instruction on <a href="/usingSAS.html">how to use SAS graphics acelerator</a>.</p>

<h2 id="list-of-data-graphics-available">List of data graphics available:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/plotCases.html">Global Evolution of Covid-19 Cases</a></li>
  <li><a href="/flattenTheCurve.html">Flatten the Curve</a></li>
  <li><a href="/cdcTestingData.html">CDC Testing Data</a></li>

<p>Through this project we are also interested in understanding the strengths and limitations of existing technologies in providing effective alternative representations. We are gathering feedback to improve how we present the graphics and to support the design of multimodal visualization libraries. Each visualization has an option to submit questions you may have about the graphic or data. Answers to all valid submitted questions will be posted on the website promptly, optionally you may opt to receive an email alert. Last, we are also collecting more general information on multimodal data literacy. You may find more information in the Survey Page.</p>

<p>This work is being done by researchers at Stanford University and University of Michigan. <a href="/contact.html">Contact us</a> if you have any questions, feedback, or comments.</p>
