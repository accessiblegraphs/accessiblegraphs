I"Ë<p>‚ÄúFlatten the curve‚Äù has become the mantra of the global effort towards mitigating and containing the COVID-19 pandemic. It‚Äôs a powerful and immensely valuable metaphor, that helps people understand why mitigation is necessary to save lives.</p>

<p>This graph has two curve lines and one constant flat line. Since it‚Äôs a metaphor plot, the numbers don‚Äôt represent real values. Instead the shape of the curves are used to communicate the message. The more people reporting with the virus on a given day, the higher the curve; which means the virus is spreading fast. This is shown as the curve ‚Äòwithout measures‚Äô. On the other hand, a low curve (‚Äòwith measures‚Äô) shows that the virus is spreading slower and fewer people are diagnosed with the disease on any given day. Keeping the curve down ‚Äî diminishing the rate at which new cases occur ‚Äî prevents overtaxing the healthcare systems and resources (represented as the constant ‚Äòcapacity level‚Äô line).</p>
